    properties: {text: 'How our tool works:


        We developed an artificial intelligence (AI) tool which uses a large language
        model (LLM) to de-identify protected health information (PHI) in medical data
        (“de-identification task”). Furthermore, we have applied the LLM to perform
        a clinically relevant task: grading of radiology report quality relative to
        a gold standard (“grading task”).

        Medical data must be de-identified when used in contexts beyond direct patient
        care, pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
        of 1996 (HIPAA). The “Privacy Rule” established by HIPAA is designed to ensure
        that PHI is maintained in a secure fashion unless needed to deliver care.
        Therefore, compliance to HIPAA is of primary importance to this tool, as the
        grading task may only be performed using data that has been stripped of PHI
        via the de-identification task.

        We also recognize the importance of delivering clinically accurate predictions
        using AI tools. As there is potential for this tool to affect patient care
        directly or indirectly, e.g. via use of the grading task to inform physician
        review processes or via use of the de-identification and grading tasks in
        research settings, adherence to algorithmic accountability principles is crucial
        to maintain trust in the tool and the medical processes to which it may apply.
